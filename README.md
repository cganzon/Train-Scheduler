# Train-Scheduler

This assignment lets the user add new information for a train through input fields. The user can add the train's name, destination, first arrival time, and frequency between arrivals. After the user clicks submit, that information will be displayed on the page for the user to keep track of. Furthermore, new information will be displayed on the page, which are next arrival time of the train and the amount of minutes remaining until the train arrives.

HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase, Font Awesome, and Moment.js were used in the making of this train scheduler.
